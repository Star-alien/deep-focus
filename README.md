## Overview

Deep Focus leverages IBMâ€™s **watsonx Assistant** to automate tasks, enhance customer interactions, and improve business productivity. It includes:

- Synthetic data generation for business operations.
- Flask-based backend API to handle conversational AI interactions.
- Integration with pre-trained machine learning models for data processing.

This project aims to transform business processes using AI to drive efficiency and enhance user experience.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.9+** (Ensure Python is installed on your system)
2. **Conda** (Recommended for environment management)
3. **Git** (For cloning the repository)

### Step-by-step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Star-alien/deep-focus.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    After cloning, move into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd deep-focus
    ```

3. **Create and activate a Conda environment**:
    Create a Conda environment (recommended) to isolate the dependencies:
    ```bash
    conda create --name deep-focus-env python=3.9
    conda activate deep-focus-env
    ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
    Install the necessary libraries and dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Generate synthetic data**:
    If your project relies on synthetic data, you need to generate it before running the application:
    ```bash
    python synthetic_data.py
    ```

6. **Run the Flask app**:
    Start the backend by running the `app.py` file:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will start the server, and you can access the project at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
